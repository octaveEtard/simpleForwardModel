Functions:

crossMatrices.m
laggedDims.m
pad.m   
lagMatrix.m 
curvePenaltyMatrix.m  

are necessary to compute the solution in this example.

The other functions: 

topoplot.m
error_bc.m
icadefs.m    
finputcheck.m
intersect_bc.m
readlocs.m
setdiff_bc.m
union_bc.m

are part of the EEGLAB toolbox (https://github.com/sccn/eeglab), and belong
to their authors. They are only included here to represent scalp maps
(topoplot function).
